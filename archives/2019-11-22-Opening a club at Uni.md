During the orientation week at University we all discussed the clubs we’re going to join. The following few weeks all of us did our best efforts to get into the clubs of out choice. With inductions opening every week of over 20 clubs and daily interviews, mocks, workshops, the decision was hard. Should I continue with something I already know or should I pick up a new activities? Among all this, came an email in my inbox : “Application for new clubs and societies”. Now , one club i was looking forward to joining at college was a tech club. Considering me recent interest in hardware and electronics and using them to DIY, I filled it up to create the Maker’s Club. Naturally, considering it was my 3rd week at Uni, and I was only a first year individually filling out a club application(most clubs have a team and a charter and hierarchy of roles, yes us Liberal Arts kids are very thorough) , I expected it to get lost among the 100 other applications.

2 weeks later I glance upon another email: “Meeting to discuss club application”. Okay, that was unexpected. 2 days, 1 meeting later, I was a clueless first year with a club in her hand. 

For the first club event I thought it should be something with which I could introduce the club to the student body and spread awareness about the Maker’s Movement. So with help of [Sai Khurana](https://twitter.com/saikhurana1), [Cocoa](http://twitter.com/CocoaThePenguin) and [Sushmita Anant](https://twitter.com/scowlingwind) we set up out first event: The Tinker Booth. The booth showcased some of our projects. Cocoa brilliantly explained the Banano piano and it’s working to everyone. Sai’s LED cube was a showstopper. The booth was arranged by Sushmita. We did light painting using [Adafruit's](https://www.adafruit.com/) Circuit Playgrpund boards and had a bunch of projects using [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/). The best part of the booth was the help staff coming and seeing how “tech is cool”, tinkered with the banana piano and asked questions. We decided to come up with a plan to hold coding classes for them.

The booth was successful as we had a lot of fun and a hood number of people texted me the next day asking when will the inductions be open.
