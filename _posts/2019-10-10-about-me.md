Hi!<br> <br>
I am Aakanksha, a volunteer at local communities and First Year CS major and Physics minor.<br><br>
My interests are: Physics, Python, Creative coding, Generative Art, Hardware and Electronics. I like exploring the intersection of these.
I once went to an art school and was almost planned on graduating with and Art degree. Throughout my life art and science have seemed like 2 very different fields of interest and I'm now just getting started to finding out how inter-related they are and how beautifully they harmonize.<br>
I want to make STEM education more approachable, inclusive and open and see FOSS as a tool to achieve the same.
