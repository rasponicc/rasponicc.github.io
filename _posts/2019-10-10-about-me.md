Hi!<br> <br>
I am Aakanksha, a volunteer at local communities and Second Year CS student.<br><br>
My interests are: Physics, Python, Creative coding, Generative Art, Hardware and Electronics. I like working at the intersection of design, data and technolgy.

I want to make STEM education more approachable, inclusive and open and see FOSS as a tool to achieve the same.

I like exploring new tech, and I usually write my first cool projects with them here.
