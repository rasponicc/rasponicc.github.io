Hi!<br> <br>
I am Aakanksha, a volunteer at local communities and First Year CS major and Physics minor.<br><br>
My interests are: Physics, Python, Creative coding, Generative Art, Hardware and Electronics. I like working at the intersection of art and technolgy.


I want to make STEM education more approachable, inclusive and open and see FOSS as a tool to achieve the same.
