With the beginning of a new year, AND a new decade, a lot of exciting things happened. Besides starting my second semester at Uni, I was also about to attend my FIRST EVER ACTUAL COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS. I was pretty hyped up for it throughout the semester break. 

Yes, the class over exceeded my exceptions. Only class for which I wished time stopped. Alas, all good things do come to an end :P

We discussed how to make spirals at one point in the second class. Of course in pseudo code. Seeing spirals coming from all polygons and eventually some sort of a circle, I wanted to try out a different method for it. Most of the discussing was based on a turtle based approach by playing around with the number of steps forward and the angle turned.  Inspired by that discussion I tried to create my mini generative system of spirals using p5.js.

Although there is so much more I want to play around in this system and then work up on adding constraints to make actual design patterns(which hopefully I'll get time and skills for), [here](https://github.com/rasponicc/generative-stuff/tree/master/generative%20spirals) is some messy code and some cute patters.
