I gave a poster presentation at PyCon 2019. It was nothing like I expected it.

I considered myself a good orator, who could command a room and move the audience. Even then, idea of giving a “tech” talk always felt intimidation. Explaining a poster at the biggest open source conference to people who are the best in their field? Even more so. I went in expecting to be lost among a crowd of geniuses, but my experience with the poster presentation and PyCon 2019 was was quite the opposite.

<b>Here, I felt the word “community”.<b>

A small introduction: I’m Aakanksha Agrawal, 18 y/o, a first year student at Ashoka University, majoring in CS and minoring in Physics or Psychology.

My conference experience started way before the actual conference, when we(me and some amazing friends) tried to bring the idea of an interactive poster on CircuitPython to life. This project required design and electronics to work together. I had been hooked to electronics and hardware for quite a while now. (Dare I admit it were Ayan Pahwa’s crazy projects, model arc reactor, FPV drone racing and other frivoulous flexes that first caught eye.) On the other hand, design had always benn my home. Here I should mention I went to an art school for about 2 weeks and was initially planning on majoring in art and design. 

After brainstorming for the basic idea of the poster, I started designing it. The main challenge was: dimensions. I had to exactly fit in circuit boards and wires onto the poster which required me to think about design and aesthetics along with dimensions and weight of hardware, base of poster, ways to actually fit in the hardware and ways to make it all work together. Not to mention I was on a deadline as we had just 7 days to make it from scratch to finish, and my college mid terms were going on: which include heave readings and three 1000 word essays(update: still incomplete). So I got to work.

2 days before the conference the poster was printed. Dimensions were perfect in the very first print. Yay!

Fast forward to the conference: we assembled the poster post lunch. Here is [Ayan’s blog](https://www.codensolder.com/blog/circuitpython-poster) post on working and assembly of the poster which describes the process in good detail and saves me the effort.  A few speed bumps that we didn’t see coming: not expecting the time it would take to assemble the poster, power management, forgetting major components at the hostel we were staying at. Fortunately with the help pro friends: cvam000, Dunken_Master, Fort Minor, Ajax, p.r.i.v.a.t.e,  they were smoothly(:P) resolved and we finished the poster in the nick of time.

The presentation was, in one word, AMAZING.

All done and dusted with the poster, it was time to attend the actual conference. My first open-source conference. A little more introduction: I’ve grown up in an education system which has mostly propagated a competitive spirit, often an unhealthy one. PyCon was the first major experience which broke this 18 years of conditioning. All around me: talks, networking, cross community meetups, open space interactions, lightening talks. My favourite 30 minutes from the entire conference was the PyLadies speed mentoring session where I met awe inspiring women. It was educational and motivational. More about me, I’m the kid who walks around with her heart on her sleeve. Hearing my heart sing and something cool, exciting and nerdy is normal. But the energy in this room made my heart dance.

PyCon was the first experience where I learned to let go of the ‘competition’ and embrace ‘collaboration’. Here I learned it’s not about ‘me’ and ‘I’, but about ‘we’ and ‘us’. It was a very unique and different educational and inspiring experience. I looked at learning and contributing from a whole new perspective, one I'd never thought about before. I made new friends, talked to some amazing people, shared and gained knowledge. Like I said in the introduction: I felt the word ‘community’
