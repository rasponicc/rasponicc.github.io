Can I say I'm a Maker now?

College was starting in a week and I had recently started tinkering with hobby electronics and hardware. That was when I saw a cool LED lamp so I decided to make my own. This project was actually the one where I found I quite loving fabricating stuff with my hands, playing with LED's, designing stuff, operating a CNC machine(It was so fun!), MAKING.

The process included cutting particles boards, drilling them together, putting in a non adressable LED stip with an IR reciever, and finally gluing acryic sheet for diffusers. The result turned out lovely! Here are the results:
