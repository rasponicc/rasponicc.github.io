In times of crisis communities come forward and help.

I finally bought a Creality Ender 3, which is an entry level FDM 3D printer. For an entry level printer it's actually pretty good and it's also highly customisable. This was also when COVID-19 had just struck. The Maker community came up with awesome models of face shields and corona keys, and open-sourced the design for anyone and everyone to print!

So I printed a few for my family and neighbourhood security guards.

[models are available on Thingiverse]
